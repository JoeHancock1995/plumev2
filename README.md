# PLUME version2

This is a project aimed at turning the plumesounding.com website into a walkable art gallery which allows the user to interact with art on the walls.

The screenshots are of the project after its last push to plumesounding.com 

Still in the early phases using Babylon.js . Current development has expanded the size of the gallery and is very much in progress. Updated screenshots will follow when the project reaches a more complete state.

Next phases include creating a larger enviroment with more interactivity and versatility within the enviroment. This includes interacting with the images, a room to display films, and sound interacting with the world. After this phase the project will be built in React Native for smartphone use and the use of different components within the device.
